    "## Question 2 - Newtonian Mechanics through the eyes of Machine Learning!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question: Given a point mass at rest at $S = (0,h)$  and a horizontal ground at $y = 0$, find a frictionless curve from $S$ to the ground that minimizes the time for the mass to reach the ground under gravity g (= 9.81 m/s^2). Solve this by framing it as an optimization / ML problem where the curve is parameterized and the time is computed numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Physics Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Gravity: constant g = 9.81 m/s^2\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### No friction or air resistance\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Point mass begins at rest: initial velocity v(0) = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### The curve lies in the 2D x-y plane\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### y = h at the start, and y = 0 at the end. $h=1$\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Motion is constrained to follow the curve\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistics:\n",
    "- #### Marks - 15\n",
    "- #### Estimated Time - ~ 20 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables\n",
    "- #### This ipython notebook\n",
    "- #### Name the file in the format - **\\<ID-NO\\>-q2.ipynb**\n",
    "- #### The 100 point csv file in the format $(x_0,y_0)$ to $(x_{99},y_{99})$; 1 point per line\n",
    "- #### You have to upload the above mentioned files on quanta after you are done.\n",
    "- #### Output the final curve (a set of 100 points $(x_0,y_0)$ to $(x_{99},y_{99})$ where $x_0 = 0, y_0 = 1$ and $y_{99} = 0$)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "- #### Like last time, you will be evaluated based on the performance of your model on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Take care\n",
    "- #### Write **clean** code. It should compile. **Code that does not compile will not be evaluated**"
