    "### Logistics:\n",
    "- #### Marks - 5 + 15\n",
    "- #### Estimated Time - ~ 35 minutes\n",
    "- #### You will find the train/test files in the folder named ```./data/q1```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is same as last time?\n",
    "- #### The dataset - The train and test set\n",
    "- #### The task - Predict the mean salary of different cities\n",
    "- #### The Loss function - Root Mean Percentage Square Error (RMPSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is different from last time?\n",
    "- #### The constraints - You can only use 2 models to make the final prediction\n",
    "- #### Part A - Train a Linear Regression Model to get the final predictions for the test set\n",
    "- #### Part B - Train a 2 layered Neural Network Model (```Inp - 32 - 32 - Out``` as total network architecture) to get the final predictions for the test set\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables\n",
    "- #### Two files containing the salary predictions on the test set\n",
    "- #### Name the files in the format - **\\<ID-NO\\>-LR.csv** for Linear regression and **\\<ID-NO\\>-NN.csv** for Neural Networks\n",
    "- #### You have to upload the above mentioned csv files on quanta after you are done. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "- #### Like last time, you will be evaluated based on the performance of your model on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Take care\n",
    "- #### Write **clean** code. It should compile. **Code that does not compile will not be evaluated**\n",
    "- \n",
    "- #### Make sure that you only use the above mentioned models as the final models to make predictions. Any breakage of rules will lead to straight disqualification"
